# Pokedex
A simple short project that I built using JavaFX in my fourth semester, showcasing 15 of my favourite pokemon in a pokedex format. The contents of all the pokemon are stored in a SQL database using SQLite3. This project was completed in 2 days.

# Features included:
Showcasing each pokemon separately, depicting its height, weight, type(s) and next evolutions.
Two types of searching methods, using pokemon name and pokemon type.
Ability to keep some pokemon as your favourite.
